# Online Shoppers Purchasing - Data Wrangling and Visualization

This repository contains data wrangling and visualization techniques applied to online shoppers purchasing data. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset and create compelling visualizations.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset" which includes various features related to online shopping behavior and customer attributes. The dataset provides valuable information that can be leveraged to understand customer preferences, buying patterns, and factors influencing purchase decisions.

## Data Wrangling

The data wrangling process involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing the dataset to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. Techniques such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and data type conversions will be employed to create a clean and structured dataset for further analysis.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization plays a crucial role in presenting complex information in a visually appealing and comprehensible manner. Various visualization techniques will be utilized to explore and communicate patterns, trends, and insights hidden within the dataset. Interactive visualizations will be created to enhance user engagement and facilitate effective data exploration.
